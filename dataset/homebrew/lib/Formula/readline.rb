    OS X provides the BSD libedit library, which shadows libreadline.
    In order to prevent conflicts when programs look for libreadline we are
    defaulting this GNU Readline installation to keg-only.

    #   When creating shared libraries on Mac OS X, the pathname written into the
    #   library (install_name) no longer includes the minor version number.
    # Software will link against libreadline.6.dylib instead of libreadline.6.3.dylib.
    # Therefore we create symlinks to avoid bumping the revisions on dependents.
    # This should be removed at 6.4.
