      Welcome to %{site_name} &mdash; **thanks for starting a new conversation!**

      - Does the title accurately describe your topic? Does it sound interesting?

      - What is this about? Who would be interested in it? Why does it matter? What kind of responses are you hoping for from the community?

      - Include good search words in your topic so others can *find* it. To group your topic with related topics, select a category.

      For more, [see our community guidelines](/guidelines). This panel will only appear for your first %{education_posts_text}.
    new-reply: |
      Welcome to %{site_name} &mdash; **thanks for contributing!**

      - Does your reply improve the conversation in some way?

      - Be kind to your fellow community members.

      - Constructive criticism is welcome, but criticize *ideas*, not people.

      For more, [see our community guidelines](/guidelines). This panel will only appear for your first %{education_posts_text}.
    sequential_replies: |
      ### Consider replying to several posts at once

      Rather than many sequential replies to a topic, please consider a single reply that includes quotes or @name references to previous posts.

      You can edit your previous reply to add a quote by highlighting text and selecting the <b>quote reply</b> button that appears.

      It's easier for everyone to read topics that have fewer in-depth replies versus lots of small, individual replies.
    dominating_topic: |
      ### Let others join the conversation

      This topic is clearly important to you &ndash; you've posted more than %{percent}% of the replies here.

      Are you sure you're providing adequate time for other people to share their points of view, too?
    too_many_replies: |
      ### You have reached the reply limit for this topic

      We're sorry, but new users are temporarily limited to %{newuser_max_replies_per_topic} replies in the same topic.

      Instead of adding another reply, please consider editing your previous replies, or visiting other topics.
    reviving_old_topic: |
      ### Revive this topic?

      The last reply to this topic is now over %{days} days old. Your reply will bump the topic to the top of its list and notify anyone previously involved in the conversation.

      Are you sure you want to continue this old conversation?

    subject_template: "[%{site_name}] Email Deliverability Test"
    text_body_template: |
      This is a test email from

      [**%{base_url}**][0]

      Email deliverability is complicated. Here are a few important things you should check first:

      - Be *sure* to set the `notification email` from: address correctly in your site settings. **The domain specified in the "from" address of the emails you send is the domain your email will be validated against**.

      - Know how to view the raw source of the email in your mail client, so you can examine email headers for important clues. in Gmail, it is the "show original" option in the drop-down menu at the top right of each mail.

      - **IMPORTANT:** Does your ISP have a reverse DNS record entered to associate the domain names and IP addresses you send mail from? [Test your Reverse PTR record][2] here. If your ISP does not enter the proper reverse DNS pointer record, it's very unlikely any of your email will be delivered.

      - Is your domain's [SPF record][8] correct? [Test your SPF record][1] here. Note that TXT is the correct official record type for SPF.

      - Is your domain's [DKIM record][3] correct? This will significantly improve email deliverability. [Test your DKIM record][7] here.

      - If you run your own mail server, check to make sure the IPs of your mail server are [not on any email blacklists][4]. Also verify that it is definitely sending a fully-qualified hostname that resolves in DNS in its HELO message. If not, this will cause your email to be rejected by many mail services.

      (The *easy* way is to create a free account on [Mandrill][md] or [Mailgun][mg] or [Mailjet][mj], which have free generous free mailing plans and will be fine for small communities. You'll still need to set up the SPF and DKIM records in your DNS, though!)

      We hope you received this email deliverability test OK!

      Good luck,
