Vagrant 1.4.1 has been released. This is a bug-fix release for Vagrant 1.4.0
and is a safe drop-in upgrade for all Vagrant 1.4 users. Vagrant 1.4.0 has
been the most stable release so far in the 1.x series and we're happy to
make a bug-fix release to make it even more reliable.

Vagrant 1.4.1 can be downloaded today from the
[downloads page](/downloads.html). The complete changelog for this release can be found
[here](https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/blob/v1.4.1/CHANGELOG.md#141-december-18-2013).

One notable improvement is that the Docker provisioner now works with
RedHat-based guest machines. The remainder of changes are bug fixes.
