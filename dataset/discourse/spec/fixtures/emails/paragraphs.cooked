<p>Is there any reason the <em>old</em> candy can't be be kept in silos while the new candy
is imported into <em>new</em> silos?</p>

<p>The thing about candy is it stays delicious for a long time -- we can just keep
it there without worrying about it too much, imo.</p>

<p>Thanks for listening.</p>
