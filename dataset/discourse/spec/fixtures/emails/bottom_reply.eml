This has been voted on; should probably be removed from the agenda, someone
just needs to confirm the vote results and get it on the website.  (AIUI the
archive has already begun moving on accordingly.)

Also voted and just needs to be confirmed.

This has been closed by mutual agreement of the people involved and doesn't
require any action from the TC.  Removed from the agenda.

There's also bug #744246, which was assigned to the TC at my request but
without any preamble so it may have escaped notice.  However, that situation
has been evolving constructively among the related parties (apparently, an
informal comment from a member of the release team was mistaken for a
release team position, so that's now being revisited), so I don't believe
this is anything we need to put on the agenda for tomorrow despite being on
the open bug list.
