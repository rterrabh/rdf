# Reseller Information

We are very happy to work with resellers for the Vagrant VMware provider.

This page is intended to answer questions commonly
needed by resellers. If you are a reseller,
all the information required should be here.

## Volume Pricing

We do not offer reseller discounts. However, we do offer volume pricing
when purchasing more than 100 licenses. In that case, please email
sales@hashicorp.com to learn more.

## Quote

One time $79 purchase fee per seat.

## Workstation vs. Fusion

The VMware Workstation and Fusion licenses are separate. They are both
priced the same.

## Purchase Orders

Althought we prefer the self-serve purchase, you may email us a complete
PO (with credit card information included) to support@hashicorp.com. We
will then process your order.

## Seats

A single seat can be used on two computers (such as a desktop and a laptop)
for a single person. The license is valid forever with access to free
maintenance updates.

## Upgrades

Future major updates may require an upgrade fee.

## Licenses

After purchase, license files are generated and emailed to you.

## Software EULA/Terms

You can download a copy of the EULA [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/hc-public/sales/EULA_standalone.pdf).
