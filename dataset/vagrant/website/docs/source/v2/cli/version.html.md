# Version

**Command: `vagrant version`**

This command tells you the version of Vagrant you have installed
as well as the latest version of Vagrant that is currently available.

In order to determine the latest available Vagrant version, this
command must make a network call. If you only want to see the currently
installed version, use `vagrant --version`.
